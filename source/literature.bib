	abstract = {The discussion paper “I4.0 language: vocabulary, message structure and semantic interaction protocols of the I4.0 language”, published by the working group “Semantics and Interaction of Industry 4.0 Components” of the GMA, also known as UAG of the AG 1 of the platform Industry 4.0 (I4.0), presented a concept for the language between I4.0 components. The main conclusion is: The increasing networking and cooperation of components enable new forms of organization and control. A clear understanding of machine interactions paves self-organized and self-optimized value creation in I4.0. Agent-based systems are an option for the realization of such I4.0 architectures. Due to their features, software agents are particularly well suited for representing I4.0 components and enabling I4.0 interactions. Agents are not only able to understand the necessary machine languages, but also the essential mechanisms for self-organization and selfoptimization in value creation. The paper focuses on I4.0 scenarios described by the Platform I4.0 that describes challenges for the industry towards its digital future and demonstrates how emerging challenges in the area of I4.0 can be met with the help of agent-based systems.},

The Industry 4.0 smart factory production must be studied as a multi-agent environment with some components (agents) in physical machine level and in virtual level. There is a scheme of multi-agent environment of the Industry 4.0 smart factory and its order how to interact for agents in physical and cyber level. To describe the digital production of a smart factory is done with terms of automatic control digital systems with random delay.

	abstract = {Currently, enhancing sustainability, and in particular reducing energy consumption, is a huge challenge for manufacturing enterprises. The vision of the fourth industrial revolution (so-called “industry 4.0”) is not only to optimize production and minimize costs, but also to reduce energy consumption and enhance product life-cycle management. To address this challenge, a multi-agent architecture aimed at elaborating predictive and reactive energy-efﬁcient scheduling through collaboration between cyber physical production and energy systems is proposed in this paper. Smart, sustainable decision tools for cyber physical production systems (CPPS) and cyber physical energy systems (CPES) are proposed. The decision tools are data-driven, agent-based models with dynamic interaction. The main aim of agent behaviours in the cyber part of CPPS is to ﬁnd a predictive and reactive energy-efﬁcient schedule. The role of agents in CPES is to control the energy consumption of connected factories and switch between the different renewable energy sources. Dynamic mechanisms in CPPS and CPES are proposed to adjust the energy consumption of production systems based on the availability of the renewable energy. The proposed approach was validated on a physically distributed architecture using networked embedded systems and real-time data sharing from connected sensors in each cyber physical systems. A series of instances inspired from the literature were tested to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results prove the efﬁciency of the proposed approach in adapting the energy consumption of connected factories based on a real-time energy threshold.},

This article presents a distributed Multiagent System (MAS) that interacts with elements of a virtual Smart Factory, developing behaviors to control the production and logistics of modular conveyors at the factory. A Job Shop Scheduling algorithm, supported by a leaderless consensus mechanism, allows the execution of tasks with diﬀerent processing orders.

In reality, there are various heterogeneous objects in the CPPS, including sensors or devices in the physical environment and algorithmic modules in the network space. The ﬁndings of this research provide insights for designing the hierarchical structure of CPPS. The CPPS, which are divided into the physical resources layer, the smart connection layer, the local deployment layer and the cloudPlatform as a Service (cloud-PaaS) layer, can be abstracted into the heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with the directed topologies, and agents with different functions represent for the corresponding objects in the CPPS. Its strength is in information exchange among different objects in the CPPS via Data Engine (DE) agents. In addition, the communication topology of the CPPS is described as the directed graph. A case study for an unmanned factory is conducted to show the feasibility of the method suggested in this paper. The proposed method could be able to act as a signiﬁcant valuable reference for dealing with the problem of collaborative control in the CPPS.},

	abstract = {The growing complexity of production systems requires appropriate control architectures that allow flexible adaptation during their runtime. Although cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) provide the means to cope with complexity and flexibility, the migration with existing control systems is still a challenge. The term CPPS denotes a mechatronic system (physical world) coupled with software entities and digital information (cyber part), both enabling the smart factory concept for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm. In this regard, design patterns could help developers to build their software with common solutions for manufacturing control derived from experiences. We provide a description and comparison of the already existing multi-agent systems (MAS) design patterns, which were collected and classified by introducing two classification criteria to support MAS developers. The applicability of these criteria is shown in the case of specific example architectures from the lower and higher control levels. The authors, together with experts from the German Agent Systems committee FA 5.15, gathered more than twenty MAS patterns, evaluated, and compared four selected patterns with the presented criteria and terminology. The main contribution is a CPPS architecture that fulfills requirements related to the era of smart factories, as well as the Reference Architectural Model I4.0 (RAMI 4.0). The conclusions indicate that agent-based patterns greatly benefit the CPPS design. In addition, it is shown that manufacturing based on MAS is a good way to address complex requests of the CPPS development.},

Dependability of technical plants will increase if control behaviour can be adapted during runtime. This is achieved by dynamic reconfiguration of faulty devices, e.g. sensors, at run-time. The replacement is based on analytical redundancy that is represented by a network of sensors and their interdependencies. This method supports the developer to sketch a suitable modular softwarearchitecture in regards to the hardware-architecture and the specific requirements of real-time and dependability. The integration of classical methods like fault-tree-analysis and graph-theory enables the developer to build a knowledge-based system so that the agents would have the ability to recognize faults, seize the needed actions within their scope and fulfil their goal. Recent investigations using a model-plant showed the feasibilities of this approach.},

This article extends this preexisting notation by modeling the relation between physical devices and their controlling software in the context of industrial automation applications. The existing notation and its extensions are described and applied to a miniaturized automation system to illustrate its dual usage: as a tool to collect requirements and as a tool to analyze existing systems.

	abstract = {In the context of increasing automation and digitization of production processes, efficient communication and coordination among agents in Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) is crucial for achieving optimal performance and productivity. This study analyzes a MAS’s communication and coordination processes utilized in a gearbox assembly scenario. The system is decomposed based on the assembly process, focusing on delay times. Messages are classified based on sender and receiver agents, communication protocols, message types, and query content. Local and network delays of each communication message are measured and compared to modeled delays. The results indicate that modeling delay times before implementation can lead to a more efficient approach to elaborating on complex systems’ hard and soft real-time capabilities. The delay times estimated through the analysis can be employed in forthcoming models, enabling the modeling of delay times before system implementation. Additionally, the generalizability of the findings allows for their application to repetitive modules within production systems.},

	abstract = {Im Zuge des fortschreitenden globalen Wettbewerbs kommt dem Standort Deutschland zunehmend die Rolle eines „Engineering“-Standorts denn eines Produktionsstandorts zu. Im Bereich der Anlagenautomatisierung werden unter dem Begriff Engineering die Arbeitsprozesse und Tätigkeiten beim technischen Entwurf und der Auslegung von Automatisierungsanlagen zusammengefasst. Die Kosten für das Engineering hängen wesentlich von der Effizienz und Produktivität der menschlichen Arbeitsprozesse und der Qualität der resultierenden Engineeringinformationen ab. Dabei stellt neben methodischen und technologischen Aspekten die Beachtung der technischen Zusammenhänge zwischen den einzelnen Anlagenkomponenten eine große Herausforderung dar. Diese sind sehr vielfältig und für jede Automatisierungsanlage unterschiedlich ausgeprägt. Sie müssen daher im Zuge des Engineerings vollständig erfasst und aufeinander abgestimmt werden, was heute zum überwiegenden Teil manuell erfolgt und hohe Aufwendungen sowie zusätzliche Fehlermöglichkeiten mit sich bringt.
Ausgehend von der modernen komponentenbasierten Vorgehensweise im Engineering und der Beschaffenheit der erstellten Engineeringinformationen wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit ein Ansatz vorgestellt, der zur informationstechnischen Unterstützung des Engineerings von Automatisierungsanlagen dient. Durch geeignete Konzepte wird eine deutliche Reduktion des manuellen Aufwandes und eine vereinfachte Durchführung der menschlichen Tätigkeiten ermöglicht. Dabei wird durch den Einsatz von Softwareagenten eine aktive Form der Unterstützung bereitgestellt, welche sich flexibel an den Ablauf der menschlichen Arbeitsprozesse anpasst. Das Konzept nutzt die vorhandenen Engineeringinformationen und bestehendes Wissen über technische Abhängigkeiten einzelner Komponenten und überträgt diese auf einzelne Softwareagenten. Auf dieser Basis agieren und kooperieren die Softwareagenten parallel zu den Tätigkeiten des Ingenieurs im Hintergrund. Sie sind in der Lage, die beim Engineering entstehenden technischen Zusammenhänge innerhalb der Automatisierungsanlage selbstständig zu erkennen, zu analysieren und geeignete Anpassungen der Engineeringinformationen zu ermitteln. Die Interaktion mit dem Ingenieur erfolgt in Form von entsprechenden Hinweisen und Lösungsvorschlägen, welche auf Wunsch von den Softwareagenten selbstständig umgesetzt werden können. Auf diese Weise werden die individuellen technischen Zusammenhänge einer Automatisierungsanlage bereits auf informationstechnischer Ebene berücksichtigt und ein Großteil der bisher erforderlichen manuellen Tätigkeiten und Überlegungen kann entfallen. Das Konzept wurde darüber hinaus so ausgelegt, dass es zu bisher verwendeten Komponentenmodellen und Werkzeugen kompatibel ist und sich problemlos in bestehende Engineeringprozesse integrieren lässt.},

This paper surveys earlier studies on multi-agent robots for each type, such as multi-robot motion-planning algorithms and exploration algorithms of multiple robots. The tasks that multi-agent robots can perform are becoming increasingly more complex as they move from single, one-time tasks to those involving many iterations.

The recent development of industrial information technologies, such as Cyber-Physical Production Systems, Industrial Internet of Things, and Big Manufacturing Data Analytics has empowered the digitalization of manufacturing processes and promoted the concept of Digital Twin (DT). As one of the fundamental enabling technologies for Industry 4.0, DT enables the convergence between a physical system and its digital representation. DT modelling is the basis of implementing DT in practice. In this paper, we propose a DT modelling method based on a multi-agent architecture. It focuses on quality control during manufacturing processes and provides solutions to gather relevant information and analyze the corresponding influences on product quality. The MPFQ-model (Material, Production Process, Product Function/Future, Product Quality) is adopted to support the analysis of main influential factors related to the final product quality during the manufacturing phase. The five-dimension architecture is used as the basis for the DT models, including (i) physical entities, (ii) virtual models, (iii) DT data, (iv) services and (v) connections. Based on this architecture a Multi-Agent System (MAS) component and a semantic engineering component are integrated to create a quality-oriented DT framework.},

The MAS has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by MAS, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of MAS, starting from deﬁnitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation. A classiﬁcation on MAS applications and challenges is provided along with references for further studies.

Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications.

Because we traced each 100-kbyte transfer at both the sender and the receiver, the measurements allow us to distinguish between the end-toend behaviors due to the different directions of the Internet paths, which often exhibit asymmetries. We: 1) characterize the prevalence of unusual network events such as out-of-order delivery and packet replication; 2) discuss a robust receiver-based algorithm for estimating “bottleneck bandwidth” that addresses deﬁciencies discovered in techniques based on “packet pair;” 3) investigate patterns of packet loss, ﬁnding that loss events are not well modeled as independent and, furthermore, that the distribution of the duration of loss events exhibits inﬁnite variance; and 4) analyze variations in packet transit delays as indicators of congestion periods, ﬁnding that congestion periods also span a wide range of time scales.},

	abstract = {The ﬂow completion time is an important performance metric for network users, and it is used in designing scheduling and congestion control algorithms. The existing TCP ﬂow completion time distributions are calculated from complicated models, and they are only suitable for short TCP ﬂows. This paper is motivated to build a simple model to derive TCP ﬂow completion time distribution that is suitable for both short and long TCP ﬂows. To build such a model, the distribution of the packet transmission latency under TCP congestion control is ﬁrstly calculated. The packet transmission latency is the time needed to successfully deliver a packet, including the time for retransmissions due to packet losses. Semi-Markov process is used to model the TCP congestion window evolution. Using the packet transmission latency distribution together with the TCP congestion window size information, a new parallel queueing model which describes how a ﬁle is transmitted by a TCP ﬂow is formed. In the parallel queueing model, the ﬂow completion time distribution is derived, and simulation results from NS2 demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed analysis.},

It centers around a high-level domain-specific language, which makes it easy for a programmer to express, measure, and report the performance of complex communication patterns. The primary challenge in implementing a compiler for such a language is that the generated code must be extremely efficient so as not to misattribute overhead costs to the messaging library. At the same time, the language itself must not sacrifice expressiveness for compiler efficiency, or there would be little point in using a high-level language for performance testing. This paper describes the CONCEPTUAL language and the CONCEPTUAL compiler’s novel code-generation framework. The language provides primitives for a wide variety of idioms needed for performance testing and emphasizes a readable syntax. The core code-generation technique, based on unrolling CONCEPTUAL programs into sequences of communication events, is simple yet enables the efficient implementation of a variety of high-level constructs. The paper further explains how CONCEPTUAL implements time-bounded loops—even those that comprise blocking communication—in the absence of a time-out mechanism as this is a somewhat unique language/implementation feature.},

Today’s proprietary technical systems lead to strictly deﬁned engineering processes and value chains. Interacting Digital Twins (DT) are considered an enabling technology that could help to increase ﬂexibility based on semantically enriched information. Nevertheless, for interacting digital twins to become a reality, their implementation should be based on existing standards like the Asset Administration Shell (AAS). Additionally, DT Platforms could accelerate development, deployment and ensure resilient operation of DT. This paper presents such a platform based on a microservices architecture and offering solutions for continuous deployment, data infrastructure and I4.0 business services. The platform is evaluated in the use case scenarios platform-based manufacturing and collaborative condition monitoring. As a result, implemented AAS-based microservices organize manufacturing, and submodels of the AAS enable cross-company data sharing for collaborative condition monitoring. Future work should focus on fault-management and service recovery, as well as integration of the AAS into lower platform layers, e.g. for improving data usage control.},

One of the key usage scenarios in the scope of 5G is ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). Among the active researchers from both academy and industry, one common view is that URLLC will play an essential role in providing connectivity for the new services and applications from vertical domains, such as factory automation, autonomous driving and so on. The most important key performance indicators (KPIs) related to URLLC are latency, reliability and availability. In this paper, after brief discussion on the design challenges related to URLLC use cases, we present an overview of the available technology components from 3GPP Rel-15 and potential ones from Rel-16. In addition, coordinated multi-cell resource allocation methods are studied. From the system level simulation results in an urban macro environment, it can be observed that effective multi-cell cooperation, more specifically soft combining, can lead to a significant gain in terms of URLLC capacity.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) application layer protocols are gaining popularity in a wide range of scenarios, where lowcost, low-power or resource constrained devices are present. The most diffused protocols are the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and MQTT. In order to ensure message delivery, CoAP features a retransmission mechanism based on exponential back-off and a ﬁnite number of retransmissions, while MQTT relies on TCP. In remote areas lacking ﬁxed terrestrial network infrastructure, the only available Internet access technology is often represented by wireless or satellite links, usually affected by losses and signiﬁcant delay. At this time, there is no information about MQTT and CoAP performance over high delay links in the literature. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative performance analysis of the mentioned IoT protocols over various conditions of offered trafﬁc, packet loss probability and delay. Our ﬁndings show that, with default protocol parameters, MQTT offers better performance in terms of throughput in any of the considered scenarios. As far as latency is concerned, CoAP slightly outperforms MQTT in case of low offered trafﬁc, low loss probability and high delay. We suggest to tune CoAP parameters in order to cope with high trafﬁc and high loss probability: the new parameters result in improved latency and throughput in those conditions.},

	abstract = {Ns-3 is a widely used as a the network simulator of choice by researchers. It contains many well tested and high quality models of network protocols. However, the application layer models of ns-3 are very simplistic, and do not capture all aspects of real life applications. As a result, there is often a huge gap between the results of real experiments and the corresponding simulations. This problem is particularly exacerbated for wireless simulations, where many networking phenomena like wireless channel contention crucially depend on the application trafﬁc characteristics. One way to bridge the gap between experiments and simulations is to incorporate knowledge from network traces into simulations. To this end, our work builds a trace-based application layer simulator in ns-3. Given a network trace collected from a user, our TraceReplay application layer model automatically generates trafﬁc that is faithful to the real application in the ns-3 simulator. TraceReplay infers and replays only application layer delays like user think times, lets the simulator control the lower layer phenomena. TraceReplay extracts application layer characteristics from a single trace, and replays this information across many users in simulation, by using suitable randomization. Our model is also generic enough to replay any application layer protocol. Validation of our simulation model shows that simulation results obtained using TraceReplay are signiﬁcantly different from those using other models, and are closer to experimental observations.},

Although, this is slowly changing with the rising interest in explicit knowledge representations through domain-specific languages (DSL), very little is known about the DSL design and development processes themselves. To this end, we present and discuss the reverse-engineered process from the development of our Grasp Domain Definition Language (GDDL), a declarative DSL for the explicit specification of grasping problems. An important finding is that the process comprises similar building blocks as existing software development processes, like the Unified Process.",

abstract="5G aims to offer not only significantly higher throughput than previous generations of cellular networks, but also promises millisecond (ms) and sub-millisecond (ultra-)low latency support at the 5G physical (PHY) layer for future applications. While prior measurement studies have confirmed that commercial 5G deployments can achieve up to several Gigabits per second (Gbps) throughput (especially with the mmWave 5G radio), are they able to deliver on the (sub) millisecond latency promise? With this question in mind, we conducted to our knowledge the first in-depth measurement study of commercial 5G mmWave PHY latency using detailed physical channel events and messages. Through carefully designed experiments and data analytics, we dissect various factors that influence 5G PHY latency of both downlink and uplink data transmissions, and explore their impacts on end-to-end delay. We find that while in the best cases, the 5G (mmWave) PHY-layer is capable of delivering ms/sub-ms latency (with a minimum of 0.09 ms for downlink and 0.76 ms for uplink), these happen rarely. A variety of factors such as channel conditions, re-transmissions, physical layer control and scheduling mechanisms, mobility, and application (edge) server placement can all contribute to increased 5G PHY latency (and thus end-to-end (E2E) delay). Our study provides insights to 5G vendors, carriers as well as application developers/content providers on how to better optimize or mitigate these factors for improved 5G latency performance.",
