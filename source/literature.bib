	abstract = {The discussion paper “I4.0 language: vocabulary, message structure and semantic interaction protocols of the I4.0 language”, published by the working group “Semantics and Interaction of Industry 4.0 Components” of the GMA, also known as UAG of the AG 1 of the platform Industry 4.0 (I4.0), presented a concept for the language between I4.0 components. The main conclusion is: The increasing networking and cooperation of components enable new forms of organization and control. A clear understanding of machine interactions paves self-organized and self-optimized value creation in I4.0. Agent-based systems are an option for the realization of such I4.0 architectures. Due to their features, software agents are particularly well suited for representing I4.0 components and enabling I4.0 interactions. Agents are not only able to understand the necessary machine languages, but also the essential mechanisms for self-organization and selfoptimization in value creation. The paper focuses on I4.0 scenarios described by the Platform I4.0 that describes challenges for the industry towards its digital future and demonstrates how emerging challenges in the area of I4.0 can be met with the help of agent-based systems.},

The Industry 4.0 smart factory production must be studied as a multi-agent environment with some components (agents) in physical machine level and in virtual level. There is a scheme of multi-agent environment of the Industry 4.0 smart factory and its order how to interact for agents in physical and cyber level. To describe the digital production of a smart factory is done with terms of automatic control digital systems with random delay.

	abstract = {Currently, enhancing sustainability, and in particular reducing energy consumption, is a huge challenge for manufacturing enterprises. The vision of the fourth industrial revolution (so-called “industry 4.0”) is not only to optimize production and minimize costs, but also to reduce energy consumption and enhance product life-cycle management. To address this challenge, a multi-agent architecture aimed at elaborating predictive and reactive energy-efﬁcient scheduling through collaboration between cyber physical production and energy systems is proposed in this paper. Smart, sustainable decision tools for cyber physical production systems (CPPS) and cyber physical energy systems (CPES) are proposed. The decision tools are data-driven, agent-based models with dynamic interaction. The main aim of agent behaviours in the cyber part of CPPS is to ﬁnd a predictive and reactive energy-efﬁcient schedule. The role of agents in CPES is to control the energy consumption of connected factories and switch between the different renewable energy sources. Dynamic mechanisms in CPPS and CPES are proposed to adjust the energy consumption of production systems based on the availability of the renewable energy. The proposed approach was validated on a physically distributed architecture using networked embedded systems and real-time data sharing from connected sensors in each cyber physical systems. A series of instances inspired from the literature were tested to assess the performance of the proposed method. The results prove the efﬁciency of the proposed approach in adapting the energy consumption of connected factories based on a real-time energy threshold.},

This article presents a distributed Multiagent System (MAS) that interacts with elements of a virtual Smart Factory, developing behaviors to control the production and logistics of modular conveyors at the factory. A Job Shop Scheduling algorithm, supported by a leaderless consensus mechanism, allows the execution of tasks with diﬀerent processing orders.

In reality, there are various heterogeneous objects in the CPPS, including sensors or devices in the physical environment and algorithmic modules in the network space. The ﬁndings of this research provide insights for designing the hierarchical structure of CPPS. The CPPS, which are divided into the physical resources layer, the smart connection layer, the local deployment layer and the cloudPlatform as a Service (cloud-PaaS) layer, can be abstracted into the heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with the directed topologies, and agents with different functions represent for the corresponding objects in the CPPS. Its strength is in information exchange among different objects in the CPPS via Data Engine (DE) agents. In addition, the communication topology of the CPPS is described as the directed graph. A case study for an unmanned factory is conducted to show the feasibility of the method suggested in this paper. The proposed method could be able to act as a signiﬁcant valuable reference for dealing with the problem of collaborative control in the CPPS.},

	abstract = {The growing complexity of production systems requires appropriate control architectures that allow flexible adaptation during their runtime. Although cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) provide the means to cope with complexity and flexibility, the migration with existing control systems is still a challenge. The term CPPS denotes a mechatronic system (physical world) coupled with software entities and digital information (cyber part), both enabling the smart factory concept for the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) paradigm. In this regard, design patterns could help developers to build their software with common solutions for manufacturing control derived from experiences. We provide a description and comparison of the already existing multi-agent systems (MAS) design patterns, which were collected and classified by introducing two classification criteria to support MAS developers. The applicability of these criteria is shown in the case of specific example architectures from the lower and higher control levels. The authors, together with experts from the German Agent Systems committee FA 5.15, gathered more than twenty MAS patterns, evaluated, and compared four selected patterns with the presented criteria and terminology. The main contribution is a CPPS architecture that fulfills requirements related to the era of smart factories, as well as the Reference Architectural Model I4.0 (RAMI 4.0). The conclusions indicate that agent-based patterns greatly benefit the CPPS design. In addition, it is shown that manufacturing based on MAS is a good way to address complex requests of the CPPS development.},

Dependability of technical plants will increase if control behaviour can be adapted during runtime. This is achieved by dynamic reconfiguration of faulty devices, e.g. sensors, at run-time. The replacement is based on analytical redundancy that is represented by a network of sensors and their interdependencies. This method supports the developer to sketch a suitable modular softwarearchitecture in regards to the hardware-architecture and the specific requirements of real-time and dependability. The integration of classical methods like fault-tree-analysis and graph-theory enables the developer to build a knowledge-based system so that the agents would have the ability to recognize faults, seize the needed actions within their scope and fulfil their goal. Recent investigations using a model-plant showed the feasibilities of this approach.},

This article extends this preexisting notation by modeling the relation between physical devices and their controlling software in the context of industrial automation applications. The existing notation and its extensions are described and applied to a miniaturized automation system to illustrate its dual usage: as a tool to collect requirements and as a tool to analyze existing systems.

	abstract = {In the context of increasing automation and digitization of production processes, efficient communication and coordination among agents in Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) is crucial for achieving optimal performance and productivity. This study analyzes a MAS’s communication and coordination processes utilized in a gearbox assembly scenario. The system is decomposed based on the assembly process, focusing on delay times. Messages are classified based on sender and receiver agents, communication protocols, message types, and query content. Local and network delays of each communication message are measured and compared to modeled delays. The results indicate that modeling delay times before implementation can lead to a more efficient approach to elaborating on complex systems’ hard and soft real-time capabilities. The delay times estimated through the analysis can be employed in forthcoming models, enabling the modeling of delay times before system implementation. Additionally, the generalizability of the findings allows for their application to repetitive modules within production systems.},

	abstract = {Im Zuge des fortschreitenden globalen Wettbewerbs kommt dem Standort Deutschland zunehmend die Rolle eines „Engineering“-Standorts denn eines Produktionsstandorts zu. Im Bereich der Anlagenautomatisierung werden unter dem Begriff Engineering die Arbeitsprozesse und Tätigkeiten beim technischen Entwurf und der Auslegung von Automatisierungsanlagen zusammengefasst. Die Kosten für das Engineering hängen wesentlich von der Effizienz und Produktivität der menschlichen Arbeitsprozesse und der Qualität der resultierenden Engineeringinformationen ab. Dabei stellt neben methodischen und technologischen Aspekten die Beachtung der technischen Zusammenhänge zwischen den einzelnen Anlagenkomponenten eine große Herausforderung dar. Diese sind sehr vielfältig und für jede Automatisierungsanlage unterschiedlich ausgeprägt. Sie müssen daher im Zuge des Engineerings vollständig erfasst und aufeinander abgestimmt werden, was heute zum überwiegenden Teil manuell erfolgt und hohe Aufwendungen sowie zusätzliche Fehlermöglichkeiten mit sich bringt.
Ausgehend von der modernen komponentenbasierten Vorgehensweise im Engineering und der Beschaffenheit der erstellten Engineeringinformationen wird in der vorliegenden Arbeit ein Ansatz vorgestellt, der zur informationstechnischen Unterstützung des Engineerings von Automatisierungsanlagen dient. Durch geeignete Konzepte wird eine deutliche Reduktion des manuellen Aufwandes und eine vereinfachte Durchführung der menschlichen Tätigkeiten ermöglicht. Dabei wird durch den Einsatz von Softwareagenten eine aktive Form der Unterstützung bereitgestellt, welche sich flexibel an den Ablauf der menschlichen Arbeitsprozesse anpasst. Das Konzept nutzt die vorhandenen Engineeringinformationen und bestehendes Wissen über technische Abhängigkeiten einzelner Komponenten und überträgt diese auf einzelne Softwareagenten. Auf dieser Basis agieren und kooperieren die Softwareagenten parallel zu den Tätigkeiten des Ingenieurs im Hintergrund. Sie sind in der Lage, die beim Engineering entstehenden technischen Zusammenhänge innerhalb der Automatisierungsanlage selbstständig zu erkennen, zu analysieren und geeignete Anpassungen der Engineeringinformationen zu ermitteln. Die Interaktion mit dem Ingenieur erfolgt in Form von entsprechenden Hinweisen und Lösungsvorschlägen, welche auf Wunsch von den Softwareagenten selbstständig umgesetzt werden können. Auf diese Weise werden die individuellen technischen Zusammenhänge einer Automatisierungsanlage bereits auf informationstechnischer Ebene berücksichtigt und ein Großteil der bisher erforderlichen manuellen Tätigkeiten und Überlegungen kann entfallen. Das Konzept wurde darüber hinaus so ausgelegt, dass es zu bisher verwendeten Komponentenmodellen und Werkzeugen kompatibel ist und sich problemlos in bestehende Engineeringprozesse integrieren lässt.},

This paper surveys earlier studies on multi-agent robots for each type, such as multi-robot motion-planning algorithms and exploration algorithms of multiple robots. The tasks that multi-agent robots can perform are becoming increasingly more complex as they move from single, one-time tasks to those involving many iterations.

The recent development of industrial information technologies, such as Cyber-Physical Production Systems, Industrial Internet of Things, and Big Manufacturing Data Analytics has empowered the digitalization of manufacturing processes and promoted the concept of Digital Twin (DT). As one of the fundamental enabling technologies for Industry 4.0, DT enables the convergence between a physical system and its digital representation. DT modelling is the basis of implementing DT in practice. In this paper, we propose a DT modelling method based on a multi-agent architecture. It focuses on quality control during manufacturing processes and provides solutions to gather relevant information and analyze the corresponding influences on product quality. The MPFQ-model (Material, Production Process, Product Function/Future, Product Quality) is adopted to support the analysis of main influential factors related to the final product quality during the manufacturing phase. The five-dimension architecture is used as the basis for the DT models, including (i) physical entities, (ii) virtual models, (iii) DT data, (iv) services and (v) connections. Based on this architecture a Multi-Agent System (MAS) component and a semantic engineering component are integrated to create a quality-oriented DT framework.},

The MAS has found multiple applications, including modeling complex systems, smart grids, and computer networks. Despite their wide applicability, there are still a number of challenges faced by MAS, including coordination between agents, security, and task allocation. This survey provides a comprehensive discussion of all aspects of MAS, starting from deﬁnitions, features, applications, challenges, and communications to evaluation. A classiﬁcation on MAS applications and challenges is provided along with references for further studies.

Besides, no known empirical research has focused on exploring relationships between Digital Twin and mass individualization. Therefore, the principal objective of this study was to identify suitable Industry 4.0 technologies and a holistic reference architecture model to accomplish the most challenging Digital Twin enabled applications.
