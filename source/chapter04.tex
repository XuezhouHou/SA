\chapter{Implementation and discussion} \label{chap: Result}

In order to verify the feasibility of the methodologies from chapter \ref{chap: Meth}, 
performance testing based on assumptions and two industrial uses cases 
are done and their results will be performed and discussed in this chapter. 
Again, the tests will also be divided into internal (\ref{chap: Result-Internal}) 
and external (\ref{chap: Result-External}) part, referring to those in chapter \ref{chap: Meth}.

\section{Internal}\label{chap: Result-Internal}
For the internal \gls{mas}, several tests are performed on the one to one 
agent communication. That means, only two agents are involved and the messages 
will be passed through the \gls{ca} which is designed with WebSocket 
and RESTful API separately in section \ref{chap: Result-RestFUL_WS}
